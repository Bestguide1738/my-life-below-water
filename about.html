    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <p>We started the Life Below Water Initiative in 2024 after seeing how pollution and waste were harming nearby lakes and aquatic life. What began as a small cleanup effort turned into a mission to raise awareness about ocean conservation and sustainable water use. Through this initiative, We aim to educate others and inspire action to protect and restore life beneath the water</p>
